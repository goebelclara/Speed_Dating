## Project description:
Based on observational data gleaned from speed dating sessions, the following analysis aims to generate deeper insights on the variables that underly matching mechanisms and to build a prediction model which evaluates the chances of a given individual accepting a partner they are presented with.

The [dataset](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/) used stems from a speed dating experiment run by Columbia Business School in the context of their research paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment (Fisman and Iyengar, 2009). The data was gathered between 2002 and 2004. Participants were asked fill out a self-assessment prior to the speed dating sessions. During the sessions, they were required to have a four minute conversation with the opposite sex. At the end of their conversation, participants were asked if they would like to see their partner again and rated their partner on several dimensions.
